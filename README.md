# PentaBot

This repository contains the Arduino source code that runs on an embedded processor at the heart of the five legged robot we call PentaBot.

## Getting Started

There are a set of standards and practices laid out [here](https://va3wam.github.io/) that explain the comon elements of all VA3WAM projects. The sections below provide specific links that point to the instructions that will help you get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

A full breakdown of the requirements for tools needed for coding testing and managing version control for the software in this repository can be found [here](https://va3wam.github.io/software/).

### Installing

A set of instructions on how to install the source code for VA3WAM projects can be found [here](https://va3wam.github.io/versionControl/). 

## Running the tests

At this time we have no tools or standards for automated testing of Arduino code on an embedded system. 

## Deployment

At this time we use serial over USB to load the inital code onto the embedded system. Subsequent builds can be uploaded using serial over USB or in some cases use an web interface to do [OTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-air_programming) updates.

## Built With

  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Text editor.
  - [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) - IDE for ESP32 based Arduino development.
